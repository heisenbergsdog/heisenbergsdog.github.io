# Past and Ongoing Research Projects

## Dark Energy Quintessence Research
### Collaborator: Dr. Morgane Konig
Examining whether a newly proposed model of dark matter and dark energy fits with well-established
cosmology. (2020 - Present)

## Physics and Machine Learning Pedagogy
### Advisor: Professor Stephon Alexander
### Collaborators: Michael Toomey, Sarah Bawabe
Developed a primer on machine learning to help researchers apply ML in all fields of
physical science. (2020 - 2021)

## Deeper Dive into Qunatum Field Theory Renormalization
### Advisor: Professor Jeremy Kahn
Explored the use of analytic continuation to define specific renormalization
methods more rigorously.

## Quantum Chemistry Computation
### Advisor: Professor Brenda Rubenstein
Developed software used to determine Hamiltonians and their approximate
associated energy for arbitrary 2D Ising models.
