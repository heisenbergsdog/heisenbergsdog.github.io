# Past and Ongoing Research Projects   
**Impact of Peculiar Velocities on Galaxy Survey Cuts**   
*Advisor: Dr. Niayesh Afshordi*   
*Co-advisor: Dr. Alex Krolewski*   
Determining how sizeable of an effect galaxy peculiar velocities makes on the number density of Emission Line Galaxies, and connecting this outcome to cosmological observables. (2023 - Present)       

**Quantum Tasks/Connected Enganglement Wedges with a Black Hole**   
*Advisor: Dr. Robert Myers*   
*Co-advisor: Dr. Olga Papadoulaki*   
Placing a black hole in the bulk of AdS and examining how this impacts connected entanglement wedges on the boundary
and scattering in the bulk. (2022 - Present)

**Dark Energy Quintessence Research**      
*Collaborator: Dr. Morgane Konig*    
Examining whether a newly proposed model of dark matter and dark energy fits with well-established
cosmology. (2020 - Present)

**Deeper Dive into Qunatum Field Theory Renormalization**   
*Advisor: Professor Jeremy Kahn*   
Explored the use of analytic continuation to define specific renormalization
methods more rigorously. (2020 - 2022)

**Physics and Machine Learning Pedagogy**   
*Advisor: Professor Stephon Alexander*   
*Collaborators: Michael Toomey, Sarah Bawabe*  
Developed a primer on machine learning to help researchers apply ML in all fields of
physical science. (2020 - 2021)

**Quantum Chemistry Computation**   
*Advisor: Professor Brenda Rubenstein*  
Developed software used to determine Hamiltonians and their approximate
associated energy for arbitrary 2D Ising models. (2019-2020)
