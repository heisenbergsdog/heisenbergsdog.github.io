The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.     

This planet has--or rather had--a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concered with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.  

'I refuse to prove that I exist,' says God 'for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.'  
'But,' says Man, 'the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.'  
'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.  
'Oh that was easy,' says Man, and for an ecore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.   


During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning" four of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos is reported to have been "disappointed" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve-book epic entitled *My Favorite Bathtime Gurgles* when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save life and civilization leaped straight up through his neck and throttled his brain. 
The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator, Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenberg, Essex, England, in the destruction of planet Earth.   





# Have a lot more quotes to post here. Will post them when I have the time to sit down with my copy of Hitchhiker's Guide and type up all of the highlighted quotes.
