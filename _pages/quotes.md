The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.     

This planet has--or rather had--a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concered with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.  



# Have a lot more quotes to post here. Will post them when I have the time to sit down with my copy of Hitchhiker's Guide and type up all of the highlighted quotes.
