# Questions Here. Answers at the bottom.
1. A man rides to town on Friday, stays two days and leaves on Friday. How is this possible?
2. You're in an empty room with nothing but a table. Additionally, the room has no windows or doors. How do you escape?
3. There are three incandescent lightbulbs (initially turned off) in a room at the top of a set of stairs. At the bottom of the stairs, there are three light switches that control the three lightbulbs. You do not know which switch controls which lightbulb, but your goal is to find out. There is one constraint: you are only allowed to enter the room once. How do you determine which switch goes to which lightbulb?   


More riddles to come!

# Answers:
1. His horse is named Friday.
2. Look around, see what you saw. Take the saw, cut the table in half. Put two halves together to make a whole. Put the hole on the wall and escape.
3. Turn on one switch and leave it on for ten minutes. This will make one of the bulbs hot. Turn off that switch and turn on another one. Immediately go upstairs. The cold bulb that is turned off is controlled by the switch you did not flip at all. The hot bulb that is turned off is controlled by the switch you turned on and then back off. Lastly, the bulb that is on is controlled by the switch you flipped last.
