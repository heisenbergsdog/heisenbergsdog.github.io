# Anti-anti-anti(-anti??) Joke (written by me)
- will copy and paste this from my documents soon

# Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Ohm, Pascal (compiled from various sources)

Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Ohm, and Pascal were driving down the highway when a cop pulls them over.
Heisenberg, in the driver's seat, rolls down the window and says "How can I help you today, my good sir?"
To which the cop responds, "Do you know how fast you were going back there??"
"No, but I know where I was!" excitedly responds Heisenberg.
"You were going 90 mph in a 45 mph zone!"
"Ah shucks!" Heisenberg throws up his hands, "Now I'm lost!"
The cop, getting confused and suspicious, goes and opens the trunk. Aghast, he calls out, "Do you know you've got 
a dead cat back here?!"
To which Schrodinger replies, "Well NOW I do..."
The cop, quite flustered at this point, moves in to arrest the four physicists, but Ohm resists!
After finally managing to get them to the station, the cop is quite concerned and decides to interrogate the quad.
Heisenberg, a pro, stays completely silent. Likewise, Schrodinger and Ohm don't make a peep. But after enough questioning, 
Pascal cracks under pressure!

# Many more to come!
