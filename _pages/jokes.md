# Anti-anti-anti(-anti??) Joke (written by me)
Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Ohm, and Pascal are driving in a car down the highway.   

They're having quite a good time with the radio blasting to "A Glorious Dawn" by Carl Sagan and a huge inter-galactic n-brane sneaking behind their car in its ever present stealthiness.   

As soon as they hear police sirens, Heisenberg checks behind them in the rear view mirror and sees the n-brane collapse so quickly into a police car upon observation that he doubts his abilities as an observer and assumes police car was super-deterministically present since the dawn of time.   

Like any good nazi-physicist, Heisenberg pulls over, rolls down the window and waits for the police officer to approach. The officer, dressed in a bright blue plastic police bowler cap saunters up to the open window and asks "Do you know how fast you were going back there?" Heisenberg, realizing in this moment that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle has many limitations, responds "Well sir, I think I know where I am but I'm not entirely sure because this might be a periodic strip of highway in which case my prior logic doesn't apply too well…"   

The police officer, having graduated top of his class in Cambridge, replies "ah my sworn nazi enemy, I never believed in your silly principle anyway! You were going something like 3e26 angstroms per kiloparsec."   

Taken aback at this chap's stupidity, Heisenberg exclaims "Kiloparsec?!? That's a unit of length you stupid Brit! No wonder hitler wanted eugenics! I'm driving away now sir! Good luck catching me after I make a branch cut to this multivalued function of a highway!!! Mwahahahaha!" And with that, Heisenberg leaves the police officer in the dust… only to forget that in the real world, pure mathematicians have no impact and e^i2pi is still equal to e^i4pi.    

The car then crashes into the back of the police car on the loop of highway and the police officer appears to be both mad and pleased that the nazi made a fatal error. And so the smug Brit walks to the back of the car, opens the trunk expecting to find a dead cat. But suddenly a live, immortal jaguar leaps out and murders the cop.    

This jaguar just so happened to be the only consciousness in the universe from which all other realities are projected. She had been playing that game of quantum Russian roulette for years but with the many worlds interpretation being right, each time she tried to shoot herself, the bullet was not in the correct position of the revolver and she lived on. 

Enjoying her midmorning snack of plastic blue bowler cap, she went up to Schrodinger and licked his face. "Ah my dear sweet, kitty," he cooed, "you seem to defy my well thought out statistics every time! It's a wonder I haven't rewritten my interpretation on quantum mechanics yet! Oh well… I'll just be like a mathematician and pretend like thought experiments are more real than real experiments."    

Ohm and Pascal - soon realizing that the cop was now dead and thus left the not very famous physicists without a purpose in the joke - promptly vanished into the ether.    

No one seemed to notice their disappearance much anyway, and yes, the ether is real. Michelson and Morley fudged their results but the physics community was so fed up with the lack of attention they received from the world that they decided to band together just for the hell of it and create a whole new fake physics. All the physics done since then has been faked.    

And upon receiving their PhD's, young physicists are let in on the truth that no real physics has been done since 1887, yet they have spent so much of their life studying to receive a PhD that they have no choice but to be sworn to secrecy.     

Anyway, Heisenberg and Scrodinger, being fakers themselves, drive off into the sunset on the seemingly infinite loop of highway with periodic boundary conditions. They live happily ever after until the Jaguar eats them and then hacks the simulation we call reality. The many worlds collapse and existence ceases.
	


# Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Ohm, Pascal (compiled from various sources)

Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Ohm, and Pascal were driving down the highway when a cop pulls them over.
Heisenberg, in the driver's seat, rolls down the window and says "How can I help you today, my good sir?"
To which the cop responds, "Do you know how fast you were going back there??"
"No, but I know where I was!" excitedly responds Heisenberg.
"You were going 90 mph in a 45 mph zone!"
"Ah shucks!" Heisenberg throws up his hands, "Now I'm lost!"
The cop, getting confused and suspicious, goes and opens the trunk. Aghast, he calls out, "Do you know you've got 
a dead cat back here?!"
To which Schrodinger replies, "Well NOW I do..."
The cop, quite flustered at this point, moves in to arrest the four physicists, but Ohm resists!
After finally managing to get them to the station, the cop is quite concerned and decides to interrogate the quad.
Heisenberg, a pro, stays completely silent. Likewise, Schrodinger and Ohm don't make a peep. But after enough questioning, 
Pascal cracks under pressure!

# Many more to come!
